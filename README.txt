A simple plugin with a form to subscribe to the newsletter in Ecomail.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a simple way to subscribe to a newsletter using the Ecomail API key. Thanks to the simple controls you can change the following elements:

* Contact list
* All text labels (only warning messages are required)
* Check box for GDPR consent (after deleting the label, the box is hidden)
* Form layout (default/none)

The plugin also extracts the number of existing subscribers, which you can have listed anywhere on the site thanks to a simple shortcode.

The form itself is also displayed using the shortcode and you can see the output directly in the plugin settings for possible checking.

### Vision:

We would like to extend the plugin with more options:

* Additional styles for the form
* Custom form styles using settings in the administration (choice of color, size, etc.)
* More forms with custom style and contact list

If you are interested in these options, please drop us a line on Github. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ or install the plugin directly via the WordPress admin interface.
2. Activate the plugin under Plugins in the administration.
3. Go to the plugin settings under Settings â†’ Ecomail Newsletter.
4. Fill in the API key as instructed in the plugin settings.
5. Save your changes and customize the rest of the plugin.
